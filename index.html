        <h2>🌸 Story 2 🌸</h2>
        <p>Remember that day when I put the bandage on your forehead so gently? Or the day when you had an accident coming to work, and I was telling you everything will be alright and checking if you had any wounds?  
        During the mock or anywhere else, I never missed a chance to look at you 💫</p>
      </div>

      <div class="swiper-slide">
        <h2>🎁 Final Story 🎁</h2>
        <p>On your special day, I want to tell you I admire you for being you — for the things you do. When others try to demean you, whether you’re present or not, I get angry and defend you. Your presence in my and everyone’s life is truly a gift.</p>
